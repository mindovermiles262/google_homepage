#The Google Homepage
The purpose of this project is to copy the markup of www.google.com utilizing newfound HTML and CSS skills.  Tricky bits include aligning buttons in a row, floating elements, and attaching footers.  My web design is a mashup of google and GitHub, where I present a fictional github search homepage.

A working copy of this site can be found [here](https://mindovermiles262.github.io/google_homepage/)

##TODO:
>Add search functionality to "GitHub Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"
